This is the course website for CSCI-2100 (Fall 2019) at Saint Louis University.
In this course, a follow-up to our introductory programming course CSCI 1300, students will learn how to utilize data structures in their programs to make their code more efficient in terms of speed and memory usage. They will also learn how to implement many of the most important data structures, and the trade-offs involved in different implementation decisions. (4 credit hour)
